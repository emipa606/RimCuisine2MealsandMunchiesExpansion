Update of Crustypeanuts mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1833592940

- Added bulk recipes for canned-stuff, lavish and extravagant meals.
[strike]- The 1.3 mod now uses the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2558008936]Universal Fermenter[/url] instead of the previously included Expandable Fermenting
- UF code and graphics by Charlotte[/strike]
- As the Universal Fermenter has been superseded by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2633514537][SYR] Processor Framework[/url] the mod has been updated to use this instead.

[b]RimCuisine 2: Meals and Munchies Expansion for 1.0[/b]

Welcome to RimCuisine 2: Meals and Munchies! This expansion mod is focused on expanding your colony’s repertoire of snacks, foods, and meals for your pawns to gorge themselves on!  

------------------------------------------------------------

[b]New Snacks:[/b] New snacks including crisps (chips), cupcakes, and icecream for your pawns to delight themselves on!

[b]New Meals:[/b] Make primitive nutrient paste in the form of Rubaboo or revel in gluttonous excess with the Extravagant Meal!  

[b]New Food Preservation:[/b] Make ingredients last basically forever by canning them! Canned meat, canned vegetables, canned fruit, and canned meals can be made at a cannery! Canneries require electricity and use steel as a fuel source.  Canned goods are not only a great way to preserve and store food (being 5x as compact as raw ingredients and last forever), but also are a good trading commodity! Everyone loves canned goods! 

[b]The Rim-Co Cook-o-Matic 9,000,000,000 XXXL:[/b] This high-tech piece of machinery, made from spacer components, plasteel, and a lot of love is your colony’s solution to.. Well, anything food related.  Despite being a power hog at 800 W, this machine lets you produce just about any food en masse.  Mass produced meals, ingredients, snacks, and drinks! Requires less skill to make stuff than a regular stove, plus saves time! The Cook-o-Matic requires both Advanced Cooking and the Fabrication techs to make, plus plasteel and spacer components (subject to balancing in time).

--------------------------------------------------

[b]To-do List:[/b]

Work on balance!
Minor art tweaks and fixes.  
Bugfixes (hopefully there aren’t any!)
Compatibility patches!
More snacks?!?! We’ll see!

--------------------------------------------------

[b]Compatibilities:[/b]

Same compatibilities as RimCuisine 2! Go read my rant over there! ;)
